# RoutineMap – Agile Prototype

## Overview

RoutineMap is an Agile-based digital prototype designed to support **SDG : Good Health & Well-Being**. The application helps users maintain a healthy and balanced daily routine by recommending activities based on their current mental and physical condition. It also allows users to add and manage simple daily tasks to stay organized.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate the application of **Agile concepts**, **user stories**, **sprint planning**, and a **working/visual prototype**.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy daily routine due to irregular schedules, mental stress, and professional or academic pressures. Additionally, people often find it difficult to decide what type of activity is suitable for them on a given day, which can lead to either overexertion or inactivity. Over time, this negatively impacts both physical and mental health.

## Target Users

* Students experiencing academic pressure and irregular routines
* Working professionals managing deadlines and mental stress
* Individuals interested in improving their overall health and daily structure

---

## System Objective

RoutineMap aims to provide simple and accessible routine guidance by:

* Collecting basic user inputs such as age, sleep hours, mood, energy, and stress levels
* Evaluating the user’s current mental and physical condition
* Recommending appropriate activities (rest, light, moderate, or intense)
* Allowing users to add and manage daily tasks and activities

The prototype demonstrates this functionality through an interactive web interface.

## Key Features

* Activity recommendation based on user condition
* Categorized activity intensity levels (Rest, Light, Moderate, Intense)
* Task and activity addition with delete functionality
* Clean and minimal user interface
* Interactive HTML-based prototype

## Agile Methodology

This project follows an Agile approach with user stories and sprint planning.

### User Stories

1. As a student, I want to set reminders so that I can maintain a consistent routine.
2. As a student, I want to add tasks and activities so that I can keep track of my daily schedule.
3. As a working professional, I want to access the application across multiple devices so that I can view my tasks from anywhere.
4. As a working professional, I want to sync activities with a calendar view so that I can manage deadlines effectively.
5. As a working professional, I want to receive activity recommendations based on my mental and physical state so that I do not overexert myself.

### Sprint Plan

**Sprint 1 Goal:**
Deliver a minimum viable prototype that recommends suitable activities based on user condition and allows users to add and manage daily tasks.

**Sprint 1 Stories:**

* Activity recommendation based on mental and physical state
* Task and activity creation
* Basic reminder concept

**Sprint 2 Goal:**
Enhance usability and accessibility through cross-device access and calendar integration.

**Sprint 2 Stories:**

* Cross-device access
* Calendar integration for activities and reminders
