# RoutineMap – Agile Prototype

## Overview

RoutineMap is an Agile-based digital prototype designed to support **SDG : Good Health & Well-Being**. The application helps users maintain a healthy and balanced daily routine by recommending activities based on their current mental and physical condition. It also allows users to add and manage simple daily tasks to stay organized.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle to maintain a healthy daily routine due to irregular schedules, mental stress, and professional or academic pressures. Additionally, people often find it difficult to decide what type of activity is suitable for them on a given day, which can lead to either overexertion or inactivity. Over time, this negatively impacts both physical and mental health.

## Target Users

* Students experiencing academic pressure and irregular routines
* Working professionals managing deadlines and mental stress
* Individuals interested in improving their overall health and daily structure

---

## System Objective

RoutineMap aims to provide simple and accessible routine guidance by:

* Collecting basic user inputs such as age, sleep hours, mood, energy, and stress levels
* Evaluating the user’s current mental and physical condition
* Recommending appropriate activities (rest, light, moderate, or intense)
* Allowing users to add and manage daily tasks and activities

The prototype demonstrates this functionality through an interactive web interface.
